PAST AND FUTURE OF JAVASCRIPT

lets go on a javacript journey

- only way to make sense out of the current chaotic situation
from monoliths to completely modular code with imports and exports

Future
- http/2 es6
- no more bundling
- versioned urls for caching
- run 2 versions of same lib
- protocol level bundling

lets try to understand

PAST
- example1 -> Monolithic
- example2 -> Global Variablesand manual ordering
- example3 -> Namespace
- example4 -> Bundling with concatenation --- too many http calls
- example5 -> Minification

Things started to change in node world. 
hence now we have 2 environments
- node (sync)
- browser (async)

lost of modules in commonjs wanting to be used on browser

- example6 -> CommonJS & Browserify
- example7 -> CommonJS & Webpack
- example8 -> AMD & webpack ---- browserify can also do by deamdify
- example9 -> AMD & RequireJs
- example10 -> almond and gulp

talkabout es6

- example11 -> es6 and webpack and browserify
d3 for visualizing data
- example12 -> rollup and es6 ----------- amazing bundle 

es6 loader specs and lifecycle and hooks
es6-polyfill
systemjs has compatible layers for other modules by Guybedford

jspm 
package manager for systemjs
- single tree format
- transitive dependency
- circular ref

es6 package management
- one line install
- one line import
- package manaher should understand the loader

- example13 -> jspm
- example14 -> systemjs

a little history -> requirejs and JAM and traceur
